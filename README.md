My Journey 🛤
While my initial journey began in the field of pharmacy, my insatiable curiosity led me to the world of data. I've always been fascinated by the power of data and its potential in healthcare. I spent countless hours teaching myself data analysis and data science techniques. Today, I strive to bridge the gap between healthcare and technology, aiming to make healthcare more data-driven and efficient.

Projects 📊
Throughout my data science journey, I've dedicated my skills to numerous projects. Among these, a couple stand out due to their relevance to healthcare and their potential impact:

Opioids Drug Analysis (2012-2021): Delved deep into the use and impact of opioids across US states over a decade. This involved comprehensive data wrangling, visualization, and statistical analysis to understand trends, potential causes for spikes in usage, and the broader implications for public health.

Health Insurance Analysis & Prediction: Designed a predictive model to forecast health insurance trends based on a myriad of factors. Alongside this, I performed an in-depth analysis to better understand the current landscape of health insurance, identifying patterns and providing insights that can be invaluable to healthcare providers and policymakers.

More of my work can be found in my repositories. Each project I undertake is an opportunity to better the nexus of healthcare and data, and I am continually excited by the possibilities.
